    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Welcome to our company, a leading organization in the field of recruitment predictions. Our mission is to revolutionize the hiring process by using cutting-edge technology to evaluate candidates more effectively, based on both academic scores and personal attributes.</p>
        <p>We understand how crucial it is for employers to find the right candidates for their organizations. Traditional hiring processes can sometimes be subjective and inefficient, which is why we've developed a prediction model to make the process more transparent and data-driven. Our system uses a comprehensive set of criteria to predict the likelihood of a candidate being hired.</p>
       <div class="a1"> 
        <h2>Our Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <p>We believe that a combination of academic achievements, skills, and experience defines a candidateâ€™s potential. Our hiring prediction model evaluates candidates based on the following factors:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SSLC Percentage (Secondary School Leaving Certificate):</strong> If a candidate has scored 50% or more in SSLC, they will be considered favorably in our system.</li>
            <li><strong>PUC Percentage (Pre-University Course):</strong> A minimum of 35% in PUC is a key factor for evaluating potential.</li>
            <li><strong>UG CGPA (Undergraduate Cumulative Grade Point Average):</strong> A CGPA of 5 or more is required for a candidate to qualify in this category. This helps ensure that the candidate has a solid academic foundation.</li>
            <li><strong>Interview Round Scores:</strong> Our system also evaluates candidates based on their performance in various skill areas, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Verbal Skills</li>
                    <li>Communication Skills</li>
                    <li>Programming Skills</li>
                    <li>Logical Reasoning Skills</li>
                    <li>Quants (Quantitative Aptitude)</li>
                </ul>
                For each of these areas, the candidate needs to score above 15 to pass this stage of the evaluation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> The system values experience, with candidates having <strong>more than 2 years</strong> of experience being considered strongly. If the candidate meets all other criteria but has less experience, they will not be considered for hiring.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, we also understand that experience isn't always the most important factor. Therefore, we have a special condition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For candidates with 1 year of experience:</strong> If they meet the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>SSLC, PUC, and UG scores above <strong>70%</strong></li>
                    <li>Verbal, Communication, Programming, Logical Reasoning, and Quants scores above <strong>15</strong></li>
                </ul>
                Then, they will also be predicted to be hired.
            </li>
        </ul>
